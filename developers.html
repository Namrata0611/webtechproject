                <h1 style="color:red">What is Flickr?</h1>

                <h5 style="color:black">Flickr is almost certainly the best online photo management and sharing
                    application in the world. On Flickr, members upload photos, share them securely, supplement their
                    photos with metadata like license information, geo-location, people, tags, etc., and interact with
                    their family, friends, contacts or anyone in the community. Practically all the features on Flickr's
                    various platforms -- web, mobile and desktop -- are accompanied by a longstanding API program. Since
                    2005, developers have collaborated on top of Flickr's APIs to build fun, creative, and gorgeous
                    experiences around photos that extend beyond Flickr.
                    has two main goals:</h5>

                <h4 style="color:black"><strong>1. We want to help people make their photos available to the people who
                        matter to them.</strong></h4>

                <h5 style="color:black">Maybe they want to keep a blog of moments captured on their cameraphone, or
                    maybe they want to show off their best pictures or video to the whole world in a bid for web
                    celebrity. Or maybe they want to securely and privately share photos of their kids with their family
                    across the country. Flickr makes all these things possible and more!

                    To do this, we want to get photos and video into and out of the system in as many ways as we can:
                    from the web, from mobile devices, from the users' home computers and from whatever software they
                    are using to manage their content. And we want to be able to push them out in as many ways as
                    possible: on the Flickr website, in RSS feeds, by email, by posting to outside blogs or ways we
                    haven't thought of yet. What else are we going to use those smart refrigerators for?</h5>


                <h4 style="color:black"><strong> 2. We want to enable new ways of organizing photos and video.</strong>
                </h4>


                <h5 style="color:black">Once you make the switch to digital, it is all too easy to get
                    overwhelmed
                    with the sheer number of photos you take or videos you shoot with that itchy trigger finger. Albums,
                    the
                    principal way people go about organizing things today, are great -- until you get to 20 or 30 or 50
                    of
                    them. They worked in the days of getting rolls of film developed, but the "album" metaphor is in
                    desperate need of a Florida condo and full retirement.

                    Part of the solution is to make the process of organizing photos or videos collaborative. In Flickr,
                    you
                    can give your friends, family, and other contacts permission to organize your stuff - not just to
                    add
                    comments, but also notes and tags. People like to ooh and ahh, laugh and cry, make wisecracks when
                    sharing photos and videos. Why not give them the ability to do this when they look at them over the
                    internet? And as all this info accretes as metadata, you can find things so much easier later on,
                    since
                    all this haven't thought of yet. What else are we going to use those smart refrigerators for?</h5>
