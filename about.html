                    <h4 style="color:black">Flickr - almost certainly the best online photo management and sharing
                        application in the world -
                        has two main goals:</h4>

                    <h4 style="color:black"><strong>1. We want to help people make their photos available to the people
                            who
                            matter to them.</strong></h4>

                    <h5 style="color:black">Maybe they want to keep a blog of moments captured on their cameraphone, or
                        maybe they want to show off their best pictures or video to the whole world in a bid for web
                        celebrity. Or maybe they want to securely and privately share photos of their kids with their
                        family
                        across the country. Flickr makes all these things possible and more!

                        To do this, we want to get photos and video into and out of the system in as many ways as we
                        can:
                        from the web, from mobile devices, from the users' home computers and from whatever software
                        they
                        are using to manage their content. And we want to be able to push them out in as many ways as
                        possible: on the Flickr website, in RSS feeds, by email, by posting to outside blogs or ways we
                        haven't thought of yet. What else are we going to use those smart refrigerators for?</h5>


                    <h4 style="color:black"><strong> 2. We want to enable new ways of organizing photos and
                            video.</strong>
                    </h4>


                    <h5 style="color:black">Once you make the switch to digital, it is all too easy to get
                        overwhelmed
                        with the sheer number of photos you take or videos you shoot with that itchy trigger finger.
                        Albums,
                        the
                        principal way people go about organizing things today, are great -- until you get to 20 or 30 or
                        50
                        of
                        them. They worked in the days of getting rolls of film developed, but the "album" metaphor is in
                        desperate need of a Florida condo and full retirement.

                        Part of the solution is to make the process of organizing photos or videos collaborative. In
                        Flickr,
                        you
                        can give your friends, family, and other contacts permission to organize your stuff - not just
                        to
                        add
                        comments, but also notes and tags. People like to ooh and ahh, laugh and cry, make wisecracks
                        when
                        sharing photos and videos. Why not give them the ability to do this when they look at them over
                        the
                        internet? And as all this info accretes as metadata, you can find things so much easier later
                        on,
                        since
                        all this haven't thought of yet. What else are we going to use those smart refrigerators for?
